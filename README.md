# mabipro-custom-wiki
Website repo for coppergear's custom content and guide wiki.

## About
As of this moment only the markdown file content will be posted onto GitHub until the underlying website code is more... presentable(*cough* *de-crapified* *cough*).
The content within the markdown files will be automatically converted into HTML.

The goal of this wiki/guide hybrid is to place information being repeated near daily on the discord onto a link-able website to reduce new player questions with a focus on custom content added by the mabipro devs
Things such as custom skills, uncaps, weapons, ego list, special upgrade list, pets, dungeons, sm's, jungle missions, the A# series, enchantments, and more are welcome here.


## Contribute
Please make a branch when making changes to a markdown file, and minimize the amount of files being edited per branch. When you are ready for your changes to be 'merged' into the master branch, open a pull request of your branch into the master branch and await for review and potential merging.

I recommend usage of markdown rendering editors suck as [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/app) to edit the markdown itself.
For uploading to GitHub you can either use a GUI git manger such as [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)  or click the [upload files](https://github.com/cjchamp4now/mabipro-custom-wiki/upload/master) button on the repo page, but be sure to hit the button at the bottom to create a new branch rather than directly going into the master branch.
